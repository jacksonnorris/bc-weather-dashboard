# Weather Dashboard

## Features

```
This app displays the current weather conditions and a 5-day forecast of upcoming weather for a selected location
If no location has been set yet, the application defaults to Charlotte, North Carolina
The application utilizes local storage to store a user's last selected location and will display this location on page load
Since I have prior javascript experience, I am using asynchronous methods to handle the promise object
If a user enters a location that the openweather API is unable to locate, the user will be notified that that location has not been found and to try again

```
